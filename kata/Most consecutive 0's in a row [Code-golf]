## **Most consecutive 0's in a row [Code-golf]**

Your program must find the longest sequence of consecutive zeroes in an integer number.

For example, the number 10002030000 has three sequences of zeroes with lengths 3, 1 and 4. So the longest sequence is 4.

**Input** :
A positive integer

**Output** :
The max number of consecutive zeros in that number.

**Restrictions** :
Do it in less than 60 (59 or less) chars.

**Note** :
The number will always have 1 or more zeroes

## **Solution:**

```JavaScript
f=i=>Math.max(...String(i).match(/0+/g).map(n=>n.length))
```
